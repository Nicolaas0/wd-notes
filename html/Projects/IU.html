    <h1>IU (Lee Ji-eun)</h1>
    <p>
      <b> Lee Ji-eun </b> (Korean: 이지은; Hanja: 李知恩; born May 16, 1993),
      known professionally as IU (Korean: 아이유), is a South Korean
      singer-songwriter and actress.
    </p>
    <p>
      She signed with Kakao M (formerly LOEN Entertainment) in 2007 as a trainee
      and debuted as a singer at the age of fifteen with her album Lost and
      Found. Although her follow-up albums, Growing Up and IU...IM, brought
      mainstream success, it was after the release of "Good Day" (Korean: 좋은
      날), the lead single from her 2010 album Real, that she achieved national
      stardom. "Good Day" went on to spend five consecutive weeks at the top
      position of South Korea's Gaon Digital Chart, and in 2019 it was ranked
      number one on Billboard magazine's 100 Greatest K-Pop Songs of the
      2010s.[1]

    <h2>Early Life</h2>
    <p>
      IU was born Lee Ji-eun (Korean: 이지은) on May 16, 1993, in
      Songjeong-dong, Seoul, South Korea.[13][14] At an early age, IU became
      interested in pursuing a career in the entertainment industry and began
      attending acting classes.[15] Soon after her elementary school years, her
      family's financial situation deteriorated, and they eventually moved to
      the nearby Uijeongbu in Gyeonggi Province.[16] She and her younger brother
      lived apart from their parents in a studio room with their grandmother and
      cousin for over a year in conditions of great poverty.[17][18] IU had
      little contact with her parents over this period of time but felt
      reassured under her grandmother's care.[18]
