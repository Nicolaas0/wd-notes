    <p>
      No man is an island, <br>
       Entire of itself, <br>
       Every man is a piece of the continent,<br>
       A part of the main. <br>
       If a clod be washed away by the sea, <br>
       Europe is the less. <br>
       As well as if a promontory were. <br>
       As well as if a manor of thy friend’s<br>
       Or of thine own were: Any man’s death diminishes me, <br>
       Because I am involved in mankind, <br>
       And therefore never send to know for whom the bell tolls;<br>
       It tolls for thee.<br>
