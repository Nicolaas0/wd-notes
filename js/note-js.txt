<!-- 142. Primitive type & Console-->
The basic building blocks:
1. String
2. Number
3. Boolean 
4. Null
5.Undefined

R E P L = Read Evaluate Print Loop

<!-- Javascript Numbers -->
Math Operation:

5 + 5;
5 - 5;
5 * 5;
5 % 5; //This is a modulo / remainder.
5 / 5;

NaN = Not a Number, its not a number but javascript consider it as a number;
example = 0/0 = NaN; 1+NaN = NaN;

<!-- Javascriptt Variables -->
Variable is a name to store a value.
Variable can be used later, and updated.
syntax = (let / const / var) variablename = value;

to recall the variable it only needs the name of the variables.

<!-- Const & Var -->
Const cannot be change the value.
Var is the oldest variable keyword. Works just like let.

<!-- Booleans -->
Booleans only store True or False value.

<!-- Variables naming and Conventions-->
Rules for naming variables:
1. No space.
2. Cannot start with a digit.
3. Camel Case. all word capitalized unless the first word.

<!-- String -->
String represents text. Each string is indexed (a positional number).
example of indexed string :
LAPTOP
012345

There are called string method. the syntax is string.method(), if we are using "()" it will executing the method.
In the method there are are arguments. arguments usually for specifying for the method.
syntax = string.method(arg);

Template Literals create a string that can be evaluated. Template literals using back-ticks.
In the template there are "${}" inside the curly braces it will be evaluated as a javascript.

Null : 1. "Intentional absence of any value"
       2. Must be assigned.

Undefined : Variable that do not have an assigned value are undefined.

Math object is contains properties and method for mathematical constans and functions.
