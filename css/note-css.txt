<!-- 63. Color Systems -->
How to get colors:
1. Named colors : Easy, but limited. There are 140 named colors.
2. RGB (Red, Green, Blue): Syntax = (R, G, B), range of the color is 0-255.
    Example :
    (255, 0, 0) = Red.
    (255, 0, 255) = Purple. (Red + Blue).
    (255, 255, 0) = Yellow. (Red + Green).
    (0, 0, 0) = Black.
* Light colors = max the colors.
* Darker colors = min / lower the colors. 
3. Hex (Hexadecimal): Syntax = #ff(Red)ff(Green)ff(Blue). ff = 255, so it can be read like RGB syntax.
